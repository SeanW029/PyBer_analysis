# PyBer_analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the new analysis is to analyze how the ride-sharing and fare data differs by city type based on the raw ride and city data collected between 2019 Jan and May, and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results:

1. The ride-sharing data among the different city types including the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. 
2. The result of the analysis is displayed below:

## Summry

From the analysis there are some disparities amongst city types, namely the total rides, total drivers and total fares. Rural area has the lowest number of total rides, total drivers hence total fares, whereas on average, each driver contributes the highest fare revenue; it is the opposite for urban area with the highest number of total rides, total drivers and total fares, with lowest fare revenue from each driver on average. 

It might make sense business wise to:

1. Reduce the number of drivers in urban areas while inceasing driver numbers in rural areas so that average ride per driver can decrease so as to lower rural driver's burden and increase average fare revenue for urban drivers;
2. Between Mar and Apr more drivers can be re-allocated from suburban type environment to urban and rural areas as there seem to be less rides taking place;
3. After Apr it might be more profitable to combine rural and suburban lines of business as drivers can be more efficiently utilized to accomodate increasing rides in suburban areas
